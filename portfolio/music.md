<h2 style="margin-top: 75px"> Mule Rave 2020 </h2>
<p> This is my performance for the <i> MU213 - Algorave: Intro to Live Coding </i> class. In this class, we learned how to use <a href="https://tidalcycles.org"> Tidal</a>, a live coding environment which works together with the SuperCollider synth. Tidal is very expressive and lets the user combine and modify the samples in many different ways. Throughout the semester we dove deeper into complex functionalities of Tidal, recording samples. We originally planned to perform our final performances by hosting an AlgoRave party but due to the pandemic we instead gathered on Twitch to livestream. Here, I use pre-written code as well as write code in real time. Hope you enjoy it! </p>
