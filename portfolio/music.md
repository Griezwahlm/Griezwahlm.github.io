<h2> Mule Rave 2020 </h2>
<p> This is my performance for the <i> MU213 - Algorave: Intro to Live Coding </i> class. We learned how to use <a href="https://tidalcycles.org"> Tidal </a>, a live coding environment which works together with the Supercollider synth. Tidal is very expressive and lets the user modify the samples in many different ways. Throughout the semester we dived deeper into complex functionalities of Tidal through our sample recordings. For the final performance, we gathered on Twitch to livestream our performances. Here, I use pre-written code as well as write code in real time. Hope you enjoy it! </p>
