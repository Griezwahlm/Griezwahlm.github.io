<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 6rem;"">Asteroids is a modified clone of the classic arcade game. Created by using Zelle graphics library, this game was the final project of <a href="https://cs.colby.edu/courses/F18/cs152-labs/"> CS152: Introduction to Computational Thinking </a> course. </p>

<p align="justify"> The objective of the game is to avoid incoming asteroids by steering your spaceship. You can make use of your limited boost, though it replenishes over time. When all 3 lives are depleted, the game ends and you get a score based on how long you have survived. </p>

<p align="justify"> You can download the game <a href="https://github.com/izgebayyurt/asteroids"> here. </a> </p>
