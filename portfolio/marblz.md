p align="justify">Marblz was written during the 2019 Bowdoin Hackathon in collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerhansencode/"> Tyler Hansen. </a> During the 8 hour challenge, we worked together to create art and sound assets while building the game in Unity. The idea for the game came to me from a physical arcade game I played when I was a child. The premise of that game was to catch the balls falling to a setup similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine"> bean machine </a> using a bucket controlled by the player and dropping them through the hole in the middle of the board. If you collected enough balls in given time you would get a plush toy as a prize. I must have played the game countless times because the bag filled with over 30 plush toys is still somewhere in the house :) </p>
