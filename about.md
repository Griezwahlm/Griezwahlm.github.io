<p align="justify">Hey there! My name is <b>Barış Ekim</b>, I am from Istanbul, Turkey, and I am a candidate of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Molecular Biology and Mathematics at <a href='http://www.mit.edu'>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</a>. I aim to mature as an individual beneficial to the society by pursuing higher education and academic merit in science and technology, and aid in humanity’s progress toward growth and development by offering critical thinking, creativity and innovation.</p>

<p align="justify">I have worked as a visiting member of <a href='http://people.csail.mit.edu/bab/group.html'>Berger Lab at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</a>, on <a href='/assets/research/rcspr.pdf'>protein structure database search via entropy-based hierarchical clustering</a> and conducted research on <a href='/assets/research/rcsai.pdf'>the integration of hydrogen fuel cells into unmanned aerial vehicles</a> at the <a href='http://www.hho.edu.tr/EN/Academic/Faculty/AerospaceEngineering/Default.aspx'>Department of Aeronautics and Aerospace Engineering at Turkish Air Force Academy</a>. I have also worked on <a href='/assets/research/rcsit2.pdf'>thermal modeling of compacted graphite iron (CGI) drilling</a> and <a href='/assets/research/rcsit.pdf'>waste textile fiber reinforced polymer composites</a> at the <a href='http://www.mme.itu.edu.tr/en/'>Department of Materials Engineering at Istanbul Technical University Graduate School of Science, Engineering, and Technology</a>.

Last summer, I was a research staff member of <a href='http://fen.istanbul.edu.tr/molekuler/?p=6482'> the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Group at Istanbul University Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics</a>, working on detecting Z-DNA formation along the S. pombe genome via web-based database search.
