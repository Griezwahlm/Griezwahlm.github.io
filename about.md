<p align="justify">Hey there! My name is <b>İzge Bayyurt</b>, I am from Istanbul, Turkey, and I am currently a freshman in <a href='https://www.colby.edu'>Colby College</a> in USA. I aim to work towards new discoveries in the field of mathematics by pursuing higher education and aid in humanity’s progress toward growth and development by offering critical thinking, creativity and innovation.</p>

<p align="justify">My research interests include group theory, analytic number theory, arithmetic topology and dynamics, combinatorial game theory, chess theory, and recreational mathematics. I partake a specific interest in combinatorial generalizations of optimal strategies for both players in chess endgames, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">the Eight Queens puzzle</a>, applications of differential equations and linear tensors on climate change modeling, and the generalization of group theory on the Rubik's Cube, for which my notes are available <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mdre4eksccb5ffc/AADJf4IoSxCdf1MHYK_SKCTra?dl=0">here</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">I worked as a research assistant as part of the the Molecular Spectroscopy Research Group <a href='http://fen.istanbul.edu.tr/fizik/?p=6536'> at Istanbul University Department of Physics</a>, where I assisted with the chemical analysis of material. I am also a member of <a href='http://fen.istanbul.edu.tr/fizik/?p=6536'>Youth Science Program at Istanbul University</a>, through which I have attended undergraduate classes in classical mechanics and molecular biology and genetics, and <a href="http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/diger/184478/iU_nun_dahileri_Cern_e_gidecek.html">visited the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).</a></p>

<p align="justify">I am a licensed chess player in <a href="http://www.tsf.org.tr/">Turkish Chess Federation (TSF)</a>, with an <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/card.phtml?event=6323154">ELO of 1844</a>, participated and placed highly on national and international tournaments, and covered in national and international media. I continue to play chess regularly, and find the intersection of chess and analytic mathematics and combinatorics especially intriguing.</p>

<p align="justify">I am a part of the <a href='http://sigmaturkey.org'>Society for Intellectual Guidance and Mentorship in Academia (SIGMA) Turkey</a>, a student-centered initiative through which students are able to match with mentors (graduate students, PhDs, and professors) to initiate ideas and pursue individual projects. SIGMA Turkey provides mentorship for middle and high schoolers in their pursuit of academic expertise and skill building, and guidance for parents to support gifted children. </p>

I am a current member of <a href='http://mensa.org.tr'>MENSA Turkey</a> and <a href="http://www.tsf.org.tr/">Turkish Chess Federation (TSF)</a>. My curriculum vitae is available <a href='/assets/Curriculum Vitae.pdf'>here</a>.
